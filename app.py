Engaging in regular exercise, such as walking or cycling, can enhance lung capacity and efficiency. A balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables, particularly those high in antioxidants, supports overall lung health. Staying well-hydrated is also crucial, as it helps keep mucus thin, facilitating optimal lung performance. Additionally, practicing deep breathing exercises can strengthen lung function, while minimizing exposure to air pollutants and allergens helps maintain clear airways and promotes better respiratory health.',
    'Lung Opacity': 'You have diagnosed with lung opacity,This is not a final report,It is important to consult a healthcare professional for further evaluation and diagnosis. Lung opacity can indicate various conditions, such as pneumonia, fluid accumulation, or other lung diseases. A detailed medical history, imaging tests, and possibly a biopsy may be required to determine the underlying cause. Avoid smoking or exposure to air pollutants, and follow any prescribed medications or treatments. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to managing the condition effectively.',
    'Viral Pneumonia': 'You have diagnosed with viral pneumonia,This is not a final report,For viral pneumonia, it is essential to seek medical attention immediately for proper diagnosis and treatment. Antiviral medications may be prescribed depending on the virus causing the infection. Rest and hydration are critical for recovery, along with over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms like fever and cough. Patients should avoid smoking and exposure to irritants to reduce lung stress. It is also important to maintain good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing and wearing masks in public, to prevent the spread of infections. In severe cases, hospitalization may be required for oxygen therapy and supportive care.',
